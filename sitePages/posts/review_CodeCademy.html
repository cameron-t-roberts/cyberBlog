    <h3>How I used it: </h3>

    <p> I initally joided Codecademy to learn coding. I progressed through a JAVA course, and knocked some courses on Bash scripting as well. 
        I have study plan focusing on C++, python, and more. 
    </p>

    <p> However, my work has required me to get additional training so I switched over and started studying. </p>

    <p>My first couse was for CISSP. It consisted of several hours of high quality lecture videos, with questions along the way.
        It also included a full replay of a bootcamp. 
    </p>
     
    <p>In addition to the training videos there are several "Benchmark" assessments to guage your skill level. Not only that, but if will 
        suggest videos to help you understand the questions you missed. 
    </p>

    <p>Overall it has been very helpful and is a tremendously valuble resource. </p>
