    <h1>About Protect The House</h1>

    <p><strong>"Protect The House"</strong> comes from hospital emergency response team, specifically for hazmat or biological threats. You must always Protect the House. You must prevent it from entering the building, contaminating people or equipment. If we breach this, if something does get contaminated, then the entire ER could be comprimised. If you comprimise an ER during a true emergency you can cripple the hospital. You cannot allow that to happen. </p>

    <p>Similarly, the fire department had a list of priorities during emergencies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Youself - If you are unwell, injured, or dead you cannot help anyone. You must take care of yourself first. </li>
        <li>Your Team - Keep them safe, they are who will help you when things go bad.</li>
        <li>Bystanders - They are not involved, so keep it that way. Dont let the incident spread. </li>
        <li>Victims - If all of the above is okay, then you can focus on the victims. </li>
        <li>Property - Lastly, save the buildings and property. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>These methodologies are based in real world, practical responses to emergencies. They both share the same fundemental nature of starting by protecting and taking care of oneself. The individual or organization.</p>

    <p>For cybersecurity, information security, we must all take personal responsibility for our actions. In corporate environments, many times when a system is comprimised it is not due to faulty firewalls or host based security, but rather a person. A human being human. Reusing passwords, writing them down in obvious places, posting information on social media, etc.. </p>

    <p>Many of the greatest threats to organizations and individuals come from social engineering,(we will discuss that in the future). This means that the human element is the most important one. Skills that can be learned and practiced can improve personal security.</p>

    <p>The same is true for cybersecurity, and cyber resiliance. It may not seem like you have much of an impact on the global cyber espionage stage but you do. The world today is data driven. AI is working to connect the dots faster than ever before. Seemingly unrelated events can be coorelated into important information.</p>

    <p>Not to mention how many of these groups will use scams, idenity theft, deep fakes, to steal your money or try to ransom your data. If your system is infected it could become part of a bot net and rented out to malicous users to perform attacks or mine cryptocurrency. </p>

    <p>The more people who are in control of their data the better we all are.</p>

    <h2>Mission:</h2>
        <p>This site was created to help people learn skills and priciples to protect themselves in the digital age. </p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I worked in many different trades growing up. I built houses, worked on farms, even worked at a water treatment plant for a while. I found a lot of excitment in emergency services. I was a firefighter, EMT, volunteered on a mountain search and rescue team in Colorado, and worked over 10 years in an emergency room. While 15 years of emergency services was a challenging and rewarding career, it is not known for paying well. With a growing family I had to look to make a change. </p>

        <p>One day I found my facebook account hacked with spam posts on it. Recovering that account and learning how to prevent it from happening again started a journey into the privacy / cybersecurity worlds. It was simple things compared to what I know now, but I was surprised by how much I didnt know. </p>

        <p>The more I learned the more I wanted to know. Then the lightbulb moment: "People get paid to do this!"</p>

        <p>That insight started me down the path to become a cybersecurity professional. A path I hope to detail on this site and help others find if they are interested. </p>

        <p>I have earned a handful of certifications, that helped me get an internship. That intership turned into a job. Now I am a Cybersecurtiy Engineer.</p>

        <p>While I have my professional work, I am deeply interested in what the internet used to be, and what it could be. The history of the internet, a small network to help universities do research has become a massive thing. The goals 30 years ago were to share information. Just getting it to work was a feat of engineering. </p>

        <p>While I was after the text file board era, I still started with dial up modems. I remember as a kid finding unique sites where someone poured there passion out about very niche topics. A favorite of mine was building medieval armour and weapons. There was finally a place that existed to share this kinds of information. People shared and learned.</p>

        <p>A internet that is full of good information, and makes the world a better place is what I am seeking. I think we could still have that. The internet doesnt have to be clickbait and scams, social media and followers. It can be so much more. </p>

        <p>I appreciate you stopping by. I hope you can learn something and pass it forward. </p>
